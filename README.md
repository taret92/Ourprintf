printf is a function of the <stdio.h> library of the C language and its main utility is to print data on the screen, be it Character, String, Integer and Decimal numbers. Our _printf function emulates this same function. It was created from structures, variadic functions, pointers and arrays. Applying learned themes and logic obtained along the process, in case of our parameter %d and %i, we use the same function since they share the same type of output, their difference is in the input.

Syntax:

Printf("Parameters", VariableName)
Parameters:

"%c": Print character.
"%s": Print String.
"%d": Print Integer.
"%i": Print Interger.
